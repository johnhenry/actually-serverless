## Adding a host

Add a new host by clicking [<button>Add Host</button>].

Visit this host by clicking its name in the list of hosts next to "‚Üí".

### Dynamic Endpoint

A newly added endpoint returns "not implemented" by default.

ùëì:

```javascript
export default () =>
new Response("not implemented", {
status: 501,
statusText: "Not Implemented",
});
};
```

Edit the textarea directly, or load a javascript file using [<button>ùëì</button>].

#### Endpoint exports

Define dynamic endpoints as ecmascript modules.

Export a defult function that returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) to handle requests.

ùëì:

```javascript
export default () => new Response(...)
```

The handler may be named "onRequest" instead of the "default".

ùëì:

```javascript
export const onRequest () => new Response(...)
```

Additonally, exported functions may correspond to request methods.

- GET - `export const onRequestGet = () => new Response(...)`
- POST - `export const onRequestPost = () => new Response(...)`
- PUT - `export const onRequestPut = () => new Response(...)`
- DELETE - `export const onRequestDelete = () => new Response(...)`
- etc.

#### Context Object

The handler can take a context object as an argument with the following properties:

- `context.request` - the [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object
- `context.env` - object containing variables defined in the Environment section
- `context.fileHandler` - file handler used to access folder defined with [<button>üìÅ</button>]

ùëì:

```javascript
export const onRequestGet ({request}) => {
return new Response(`GET request sent to ${request.url}`);
}
export const onRequestPost ({request}) => {
return new Response(`POST request sent to ${request.url}`);
}
export const onRequest ({request}) => {
return new Response(`${request.method} request sent to ${request.url}`);
}
```

#### Browser APIs.

Endpoint functions have access to everything available in your browser window (fetch, alert -- just to name a few). These can all be used to process and handle HTTP requests.

You are only limited by your imagination. Here are some ideas:

- Use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for persistant storage.
- Access other resources using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch), [web sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), and [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API).
- Access the [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) for logging.
- Access [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert),
  [confirm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert),
  and [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) dialogs to handle requests in real time. (note: the handler may need to be asnychronous)
- Access Browser extensions like [ipfs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch?hl=en) to pull in data from other sources.

### Hosting a Static Folder

Select a folder using [<button>üìÅ</button>]
and remove all text from the textarea
to serve that directory at the endpoint.

ùëì:

```javascript

```

Instead of leaving it empty, you may replace the text with "fs:".

ùëì:

```javascript
fs:

```

You can also manually access the fileHandler object to access files
in a custom endpoint.

ùëì:

```javascript
// Only return .html files
export default async ({ request, fileHandler }) => {
  if (!request.url.endsWith(".html")) {
    return new Response("forbidden", {
      status: 404,
    });
  }
  return fileHandler(request.url);
};
```

### Proxy URL

Replace the text in the textarea with "proxy: <url>" to direct requests to that URL.

ùëì:

```
proxy:https://...
```

### Remove a Host

Remove host from node by clicking [<button>‚úñ</button>]. If the host still exists on other node, it will still be visible; but less functional.

### Load Balancer

Clicking [<button>+</button>] duplicates a host on a new node (browser tabs). The new node shares handling of requests to that host.

Update the strategy used to shared handling of hosts by
clicking the dots (‚óè ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè) next to the host name.

- <i style="color:Crimson">‚óã</i> ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè First -- Use the first active node defined
- ‚óè <i style="color:GoldenRod">‚óã</i> ‚óè ‚óè Last Used - Use previously active node
- ‚óè ‚óè <i style="color:ForestGreen">‚óã</i> ‚óè Round Robin -- Sequentially cycle through nodes
- ‚óè ‚óè ‚óè <i style="color:DeepSkyBlue">‚óã</i> Random -- Randomly cycle through nodes

When a host does not exist on a node,
it can be "claimed" on that node
by clicking [<button>‚ñº</button>].

### Save and Restore

Save and restore the cluster using
[<button>save</button>] and [<button>restore</button>], respectively.

## Other Tabs

Most work happens on the Host, but other tabs in the application provide various functionality.

### Environment

Define variables used in endpoints here.

They are available in both the context.env object that's passed to the request handler, as well as globally within the endpoint's closure.

Enviromnemt:

```
x=1
y=2
```

ùëì:

```javascript
export default ({ env }) => {
  return new Response(`${env.x} + ${y} = ${env.x + y}`);
};
```

### Requests

Send HTTP requests to locally defined hosts.

A few known file types -- html, images, etc. -- are rendered directly in the history of responses.

Download the response body by clicking content-type header value.

The history is ephemeral and will disappear when the tab is closed or reloaded.

### Logs

View logs for request sent to the current tab.
These are ephemeral and will disappear when the tab is closed or reloaded.

### Settings

Update local settings for the app.
